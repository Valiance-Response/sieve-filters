# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in our static website, please report it to us by sending an email to [infosec@valianceresponse.org](mailto:infosec@valianceresponse.org). We take security issues very seriously and will respond to your report as quickly as possible.

## Scope

This security policy applies only to our static website hosted on GitHub Pages. It does not apply to any other websites or services.

## Vulnerability Disclosure

We ask that you do not disclose any vulnerabilities publicly until we have had a chance to investigate and address them. We will work with you to ensure that any vulnerabilities are fixed before they are made public.

## Bug Bounty Program

At this time, we do not offer a bug bounty program for our static website.

## Secure Development Practices

We take security seriously and follow secure development practices, including:

- Regularly updating our software and dependencies to ensure we are using the most secure versions available.
- Conducting regular security audits of our code and infrastructure.
- Restricting access to sensitive data and systems to only authorized personnel.

## Acknowledgements

We appreciate the work of security researchers in helping to keep our website secure. If you report a security vulnerability to us, we will acknowledge your contribution in our security advisory, unless you request to remain anonymous.
